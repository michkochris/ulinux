## uports: a simple and universal linux ports collection - GPLV3

 The goal of this project is to have a simple and universal collection of
 build scripts "in shell script" to configure, compile & package linux programs from source.
 There should be as little shell varibles and funtions as possible, in order to keep it simple 
 and universal, this way others may draw as much as they can out of it and take what they need.
 to achieve a ports collection easily forkable or editable to fit the needs
 of many linux distributions...
#
 Also this ports collection will be the base of different package management
 systems I wish to experiment on, as my main hobby is custom linux from scratch,
 it will also help develop a full blown linux distribution one day... linuxchrist@gmail.com
